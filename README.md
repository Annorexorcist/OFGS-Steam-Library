Library theme for use with <a href="https://github.com/ungstein/Flat-Green-Steam">OFGS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SteamFriendsPatcher">SteamFriendsPatcher<a>. A lot of unnecessary padding as been removed to free up screen real estate. Transitions and gradients have also been removed.

Installing
-

* Make sure SteamFriendsPatcher.exe is running.
* Make sure Steam Beta is checked in SteamFriendsPatcher Settings.
* Copy the **steamui** folder into your Steam installation folder (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam").
* Optional webkit.css can be placed in skins\OFGSremake\resource to remove additional fluff such as What's New, Ratings, Add to Activity Feed and Trading Cards.

Uninstalling
-

* Exit SteamFriendsPatcher. Make sure SteamFriendsPatcher is not set to run on startup (Settings > uncheck "Start with Windows")
* Delete the **steamui** folder, then restart Steam. This will force Steam to download and extract the current Steam package, giving you the original Library files.
